This comparison is however not fair, because these algorithms have to start from scratch, humans enter the task with a large amount of prior/background knowledge, encoded in their brains and DNA. Humans don't learn every time from scratch, but they are fine-tuning and recombining a set of pre-existing skills.\n",

MAML \"trains the model to be easy to fine-tune.\" MAML was successfully applied to few-shot image classification benchmarks and to policy-gradient-based reinforcement learning. **[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning_(computer_science))]**\n",
