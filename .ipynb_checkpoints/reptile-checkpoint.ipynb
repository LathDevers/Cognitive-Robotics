This comparison is however not fair, because these algorithms have to start from scratch, humans enter the task with a large amount of prior/background knowledge, encoded in their brains and DNA. Humans don't learn every time from scratch, but they are fine-tuning and recombining a set of pre-existing skills.\n",

    "Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) was introduced in 2017 by Chelsea Finn et al. Given a sequence of tasks, the parameters of a given model are trained such that few iterations of gradient descent with few training data from a new task will lead to good generalization performance on that task. MAML \"trains the model to be easy to fine-tune.\" MAML was successfully applied to few-shot image classification benchmarks and to policy-gradient-based reinforcement learning. **[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning_(computer_science))]**\n",

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. **[[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400)]**\n",
